# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project implements a sophisticated machine learning solution to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using a Decision Tree Classifier from scikit-learn, the system analyzes various transaction features to identify potential fraud cases in real-time. The model helps financial institutions and credit card companies to minimize fraud risks and protect their customers.

## Project Description
Credit card fraud is a significant concern in the financial industry, with millions of dollars lost annually to fraudulent transactions. This project addresses this challenge by:

1. **Data Analysis**: 
   - Processing historical credit card transaction data
   - Analyzing transaction patterns and characteristics
   - Identifying key indicators of fraudulent behavior

2. **Machine Learning Implementation**:
   - Using Decision Tree Classification for fraud detection
   - Feature engineering to improve model accuracy
   - Handling imbalanced datasets (as fraudulent transactions are typically rare)
   - Model optimization through hyperparameter tuning

3. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
   - Focus on minimizing false positives while maintaining high fraud detection rate
   - ROC curve analysis for model performance assessment

## Technical Details

### Data Processing
